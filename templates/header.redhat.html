  To use this repository, run the following command:

  WARNING: The gpg key use to sign our packages has been updated on the 16 of April 2020, therefore you need to reimport it if you did before this date.

  <pre class="text-white bg-dark">

  sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/{{artifactName}}.repo <span class="hostname"></span>/{{os_family}}{{releaseline}}/{{artifactName}}.repo
  sudo rpm --import <span class="hostname"></span>/{{os_family}}{{releaseline}}/{{organization}}.key
  </pre>

  <p>
  If you've previously imported the key from Jenkins, the <code>rpm --import</code> will fail because
  you already have a key. Please ignore that and move on.

  <pre class="text-white bg-dark">

  yum install {{artifactName}}
  </pre>
